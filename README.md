Introduction
The Fake News Detection System aims to identify and classify news articles as either real or fake. With the increasing spread of misinformation, especially on social media, this system provides an important tool to help users verify the authenticity of news sources using machine learning models.

Features
Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
Machine Learning Models: Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify news.
Evaluation: Performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Scalable: Easily adaptable to include new models and datasets.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation.
Numpy: Numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and evaluation.
NLTK/Spacy: Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for text preprocessing.
Dataset
The system uses publicly available datasets, such as:
